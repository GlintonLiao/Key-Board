USERS contacting SCRIBE to ask that their USER INFORMATION and USER DATA not be tracked will be provided with a copy of this POLICY as well as a link to all source codes as proof that they are not being tracked.

3. Third-Party Data

This SERVICE makes use of third-party data. All data used in the creation of this SERVICE comes from sources that allow its full use in the manner done so by the SERVICE. Specifically, the data for this SERVICE comes from Wikidata and Wikipedia.

Specifically, the basis of this project was the project CustomKeyboard by Ethan Sarif-Kattan. CustomKeyboard was released under an MIT license, with this license being available at https://github.com/EthanSK/CustomKeyboard/blob/master/LICENSE.

5. Third-Party Services

This SERVICE makes use of third-party services to manipulate some of the third-party data. Specifically, data has been translated using models from Hugging Face transformers. This service is covered by a Apache License 2.0, which states that it is available for commercial use, modification, distribution, patent use, and private use. The license for the aforementioned service can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/LICENSE.
